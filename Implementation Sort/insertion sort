Insertion sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much like sorting playing cards in your hands; you pick one card at a time and insert it into its correct position among the already sorted cards.

How Insertion Sort Works:
Start with the first element: Consider the first element to be sorted.
Pick the next element: Move to the next element and compare it with the elements in the sorted part of the array.
Shift elements: Shift all the elements in the sorted part of the array that are greater than the element being compared.
Insert the element: Insert the element in its correct position.
Repeat: Repeat steps 2-4 for all elements until the entire array is sorted.
Steps for Insertion Sort:
Assume the first element is already sorted.
Take the next element and compare it with the elements in the sorted section.
Shift the sorted elements to the right until the correct position for the current element is found.
Insert the current element into its correct position.
Repeat until all elements are sorted.
